    <title>Overview</title>

    <para>easyb is a behavior driven development framework for the Java
    platform. By using a Domain Specific Language, easyb aims to enable
    executable, yet readable documentation.</para>

    <section>
      <title>History</title>

      <para>Behavior driven development (or BDD) isn't anything new or
      revolutionary-- it's just an evolutionary offshoot of test driven
      development, in which the word test is replaced by the word should.
      Semantics aside, a lot of people have found that the concept of should
      is a much more natural development driver than the concept of testing.
      In fact, when you think in terms of behavior (i.e. shoulds) you'll find
      that writing specifications is easier to do first, which is the intent
      of test driven development in the first place.</para>

      <para>What came next was a natural progression from idea to
      implementation. The idea of TDD had become widely accepted, primarily
      because of its freely available tooling in the form of JUnit. BDD is
      following the same path and pulling it to the forefront are a new crop
      of tools to support it. One of the first was JBehave by Dan North. Dan
      is regarded as one of the fathers of BDD thru his role in defining it
      and evangelizing those concepts. JBehave implemented many of the ideas
      and terms of BDD and did so in code which is the real reference for most
      developers.</para>

      <para>There was still a significant problem. BDD by its nature is a very
      Stakeholder centric process and trying to marry up Non-Technical folks
      with Java syntax is just a recipe for failure or frustration at best.
      Around the same time, ruby had taken off thanks to Rails and as such
      DomainSpecificLanguages were becoming a hotbed of discussion among
      developers. It was only a matter of time before all of the above met at
      the crossroads. RSpec was first on the scene and provided an early form
      of BDD that used 'it should' as its primary means of describing
      behavior. It was a fantastic spark to the community and most assuredly a
      step in the right direction but it too had its drawbacks. RSpec ran on
      the Ruby VM and this left the Java world out in the cold. Running RSpec
      via JRuby was possible but JRuby was a fledgeling project and also came
      with its own baggage, not the least of which was that Enterprise
      organizations weren't ready to embrace Ruby or even JRuby.</para>

      <para>Enter groovy and easyb. Groovy runs natively on the JVM with
      nothing more than a jar file in the classpath. This is key to lowering
      the barriers of adoption by that Enterprise segment of the population.
      What Groovy also provides is a dynamic language with all the power and
      syntatic sugar opportunities for creating a rich DSL. With all the
      pieces now available, easyb was primed to step in and put them all in
      place.</para>

      <para>Easyb accomplishes all of these goals in spades as you'll see
      throughout this document. Goal #1 has always been, and continues to be,
      that it must be easy. To do so, easyb provides out of the box a slew of
      great features and the easyb team has bundled along with (and built on
      top of them) a suite of products and plugins.</para>

    <title>Intro to BDD</title>

    <para>Test Driven Development has proved itself useful for a number of
    reasons. Improving code quality up front, documenting the intentions of
    the code its testing (to a small extent), and even assure that bugs are
    not reintroduced during refactoring. It does not, however, work well to
    capture the requirements for which the application code is supposed to be
    implementing. What often happens is that a separate set of requirements
    are created and maintained. Even worse is that the interpretation of those
    requirements is most likely different between those that created them and
    those that are writing code to implement them. This can be directly linked
    to cost of a project because work has to be redone to make the code
    reflect what the requirements creators had in mind.</para>

    <para>Behavior Driven Development takes the approach that Stakeholders and
    Developers should be on the same page when it comes to interpretation of
    requirements. It is accomplished by changing the verbiage used when
    defining requirements. This is a key factor because Stakeholders are most
    often not technical, however, the developers that they employ to implement
    their requirements primarily know how to communicate in very technical
    terms. So a common pattern of capturing requirements was created. It is
    very specific about capturing exactly the context, events and outcomes
    that make up a requirement, or in BDD terms, a scenario. The scenario is
    captured in this form:</para>

    <programlisting>given an initial context
when an event occurs
then ensure the outcome</programlisting>

    <para>Writing scenarios in this fashion removes the ambiguity and allows
    both sides to focus on properly capturing, and implementing, the
    requirements, knowing they are on the same page.</para>

    <para>Lets look at an example requirement and how it fits into the BDD
    model. The ubiquitous Bank Account example should do just fine.</para>

    <programlisting>given "an account with 100 dollars"
when "account holder withdrawls 20 dollars"
then "account should have 80 dollars left"</programlisting>

    <para>This is clearly capturing the requirement, and not a single line of
    code was written. What was just defined was a scenario consisting of the
    context, events and expected outcomes. Since we now have a complete
    scenario, we'll go ahead and explicitly state that as well.</para>

    <programlisting>scenario "money is withdrawn from an account containing sufficient funds"
  given "an account with 100 dollars"
  when "account holder withdrawls 20 dollars"
  then "account should have 80 dollars left"</programlisting>

    <para>Multiple scenarios that are members of a logical theme can be
    grouped together in a story.</para>

    <programlisting>AccountWithdrawlStory

scenario "money is withdrawn from an account containing sufficient funds"
  given "an account with 100 dollars"
  when "account holder withdrawls 20 dollars"
  then "account should have 80 dollars left"

scenario "money is withdrawn from an account with insufficient funds"
  given "an account with 10 dollars"
  when "account holder withdrawls 20 dollars"
  then "account holder should be notified about the insufficient funds"
  and "then account should still have 10 dollars"</programlisting>

    <para>Additionally, further clarity around exactly what viewpoint this is
    being written from can be added via a narrative.</para>

    <programlisting>AccountWithdrawlStory

narrative "scenarios written from the viewpoint of bank"
  as a "bank"
  i want "to verify that withdrawls work on accounts with sufficient and insufficient funds"
  so that "i do not lose money or confuse the customers" 
  

scenario "money is withdrawn from an account containing sufficient funds"
  given "an account with 100 dollars"
  when "account holder withdrawls 20 dollars"
  then "account should have 80 dollars left"

scenario "money is withdrawn from an account with insufficient funds"
  given "an account with 10 dollars"
  when "account holder withdrawls 20 dollars"
  then "account holder should be notified about the insufficient funds"
  and "then account should still have 10 dollars"</programlisting>

    <para>What we have accomplished here is to establish a conversation
    between stakeholder and developer in common terms. Effectively we are
    capturing the behavior of a system and from that we can derive our
    specific development tasks.</para>
  </chapter>

  <chapter>
    <title>BDD the easyb way</title>

    <para>"Ok, great. Looks like just another way for the business to bury me
    in more requirements documents.", you say. What if we can actually make
    that documentation executable. Thats right, take it almost verbatim and
    run it. Easyb allows exactly that. First we'll focus on just one of the
    bank account scenarios and sprinkle in some very minor syntax
    additions.</para>

    <programlisting>scenario "money is withdrawn from an account containing sufficient funds", {
  given "an account with 100 dollars"
  when "account holder withdrawls 20 dollars"
  then "account should have 80 dollars left"
}</programlisting>

    <para>That should do it. A comma and two braces. That wasn't too painful
    was it? Now lets run it. Save that text into a file named
    AccountWithdrawl.story and then tell easyb where to find it.</para>

    <programlisting width="">java -cp easyb-0.9.3.jar:commons-cli-1.1.jar:groovy-1.5.4.jar \
&gt;  org.disco.easyb.BehaviorRunner \
&gt;  ./behavior/groovy/org/disco/bdd/story/account/AccountWithdrawl.story</programlisting>

    <para>It worked and we even get some feedback to boot. It tells us that we
    have run the Account Withdrawl story which contains one scenario, none of
    which failed and one is pending. Pending? Interesting. Out of the box if
    you don't provide any actual code to verify objects and behaviors the
    scenario is marked as pending. This is an undeniably useful way to bridge
    the gap between a scenario the Stakeholder hands you and one that you've
    since had time and domain understanding to write the code to verify the
    behavior.</para>

    <programlisting>Running account withdrawl story (AccountWithdrawl.story)
Scenarios run: 1, Failures: 0, Pending: 1, Time Elapsed: 0.453 sec

1 behavior run (including 1 pending behavior) with no failures</programlisting>

    <para>We shouldn't forget about the other scenario given to us, so we'll
    add it to the same story now.</para>

    <programlisting>scenario "money is withdrawn from an account containing sufficient funds", {
  given "an account with 100 dollars"
  when "account holder withdrawls 20 dollars"
  then "account should have 80 dollars left"
}

scenario "money is withdrawn from an account with insufficient funds", {
  given "an account with 10 dollars"
  when "account holder withdrawls 20 dollars"
  then "account holder should be notified about the insufficient funds"
  and "then account should still have 10 dollars"
}</programlisting>

    <para>Run it again and we see the same story now has two behaviors, no
    failures and 2 pending.</para>

    <programlisting>Running account withdrawl story (AccountWithdrawl.story)
Scenarios run: 2, Failures: 0, Pending: 2, Time Elapsed: 0.495 sec

2 total behaviors run (including 2 pending behaviors) with no failures</programlisting>

    <para>Enough hocus pocus, on to actually writing some code. We are given a
    disambiguated set of requirements and it is now far easier for Developers
    to think in terms of 'should' instead of 'test'. Its just more natural as
    a human (which developers have sometimes been accused of being) to think
    in terms of 'it should do xyz'. Again we'll focus on a single scenario, so
    let's start with the sufficient funds behavior.</para>

    <programlisting>scenario "money is withdrawn from an account containing sufficient funds", {
  given "an account with 100 dollars", {
    account = new Account(100);
  }

  when "account holder withdrawls 20 dollars", {
    account.withdrawl 20
  }

  then "account should have 80 dollars left", {
    account.balance.shouldBe 80
  }
}

...</programlisting>

    <para>Still human readable, yet fully functional validation of behavior.
    What are we waiting for, run it!</para>

    <para>Uh-oh. We forgot to add the Account class itself. Create an Account
    class with a balance member variable and a withdrawl method. It can be in
    pure Java, or groovy, we'll stick with Java for now.</para>

    <programlisting>package org.disco.bdd.account;

public class Account {
    private int balance;

    public Account(int initialBalance) {
        balance = initialBalance;
    }

    public int getBalance() {
        return balance;
    }

    public void withdrawl(int withdrawlAmount) {
        balance = balance - withdrawlAmount;
    }
}</programlisting>

    <para>Import that into the story.</para>

    <programlisting>import org.disco.bdd.account.Account

scenario "money is withdrawn from an account containing sufficient funds", {
  given "an account with 100 dollars", {
    account = new Account(100);
  }

  when "account holder withdrawls 20 dollars", {
    account.withdrawl 20
  }

  then "account should have 80 dollars left", {
    account.balance.shouldBe 80
  }
}

...</programlisting>

    <para>Add the location of the Account.class to the classpath and kick it
    off again.</para>

    <programlisting>java -cp easyb-0.9.3.jar:commons-cli-1.1.jar:groovy-1.5.4.jar:target/behavior-classes \
&gt; org.disco.easyb.BehaviorRunner \ 
&gt; ./behavior/groovy/org/disco/bdd/story/account/AccountWithdrawl.story
 
Running account withdrawl story (AccountWithdrawl.story)
Scenarios run: 2, Failures: 0, Pending: 1, Time Elapsed: 0.538 sec

2 total behaviors run (including 1 pending behavior) with no failures</programlisting>

    <para>Only one behavior is pending now. Lets review what we did in the
    snippet above. We created an instance of an account, with a balance of 100
    dollars, because that is what the 'given' told us we should do. Twenty
    dollars was then withdrawn because that is what the 'when' told us we
    should be doing. It may look a little different than standard Java but
    that is just normal groovy syntax. Finally, we verified that 80 dollars
    still exists in the account because, yes you got it, the 'then' told us
    that is what was expected. Here is where you encounter some of the
    syntatic sugar of easyb. The assertion is done in a very readable fashion
    via the 'should' enhancements available on objects. More focus is given to
    the 'ensure' and 'should' syntax in the Syntax chapter.</para>

    <para>So far we have successful as well as pending scenarios. If we were
    all perfect we could stop right there. We're human so we know better,
    thats why we'll now see what happens when we expect a particular outcome
    but end up with something different.</para>

    <para>Finishing the second scenario and running it will give us exactly
    that opportunity.</para>

    <programlisting>...

scenario "money is withdrawn from an account with insufficient funds", {
  given "an account with 10 dollars", {
   account = new Account(10);
  }
  when "account holder withdrawls 20 dollars", {
    account.withdrawl 20
  }
  then "account holder should be notified about the insufficient funds", {
    // will cover in the next step
  }
  and "then account should still have 10 dollars", {
    account.balance.shouldBe 10
  }
}


...</programlisting>

2 total behaviors run with 1 failure</programlisting>

    <para>According to our requirements it appears that our Account class
    needs a little better logic.</para>

    <para>Shown below is just the change necessary to the Account class. A
    minimal amount of logic to validate that we cannot overdraw the
    account.</para>

    <programlisting>...

    public void withdrawl(int withdrawlAmount) {
        if(balance - withdrawlAmount &lt; 0) {
            throw new RuntimeException("This should really be a checked exception, but keeping the list of classes small for the tutorial");
        } else {
            balance = balance - withdrawlAmount;            
        }
    }

...
</programlisting>

    <para>A small change to the story itself is in order as well. This is so
    we can ensure that an exception is thrown when we try to withdrawl more
    than allowed.</para>

    <programlisting>...

  then "account holder should be notified about the insufficient funds", {
    ensureThrows(RuntimeException){
      withdrawl()
     }
  }


...
</programlisting>

    <para>Run it and we find that all is indeed good again. What we did was to
    create a closure to hold the execution of the withdrawl and then call it
    within the scope of an ensureThrows. That allows easyb to validate that
    the specified exception was indeed thrown. Since the logic was changed to
    prevent an overdraw you'll notice that the other condition (of the account
    balance still being 10 dollars) was satisfied.</para>

          <glossdef>
            <para>Agile software development technique that encourages
            collaboration between developers, QA and non-technical or business
            participants in a software project. It was originally conceived in
            2003 by Dan North [1] as a response to Test Driven Development,
            and has evolved over the last few years. The focus of BDD is the
            language and interactions used in the process of software
            development. Behavior-driven developers use their native language
            in combination with the ubiquitous language of Domain Driven
            Design to describe the purpose and benefit of their code. This
            allows the developers to focus on why the code should be created,
            rather than the technical details, and minimizes translation
            between the technical language in which the code is written and
            the domain language spoken by the business, users, stakeholders,
            project management etc. (Courtesy:
