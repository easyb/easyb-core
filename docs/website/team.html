				reducing complexity.
				The loves of his life are his daughter Sheridon and his wife <a
				href="http://blonniebrooks.com">Blonnie</a> who is a professional
				photographer. Having dabbled in the Ruby world, Ken saw an evolution with rSpec but
				still felt that the it/should syntax wasn't quite hitting the mark.
				Andrew Glover (who Ken knew from NFJS conferences) pointed him at Dan
				North's site which ultimately led to the introduction of the Story
				syntax (Given/When/Then).
				HtmlReports, CI builds, the original plugin system and cleaning up the
				initial Gant build scripts were all part of his contributions while he
				was active.
				Ken has been largely inactive with easyb over the past year but
				continues to be amazed by the work done by the team and the community
				as a whole.

				Ken Brooks is currently a Technical Lead at <a href="http://www.jpmorganchase.com/corporate/Home/home.htm">JPMorgan Chase</a> and a
				bdd/easyb evangelist whenever someone will listen</p>

				and wreck (and then fix) computer programs.  He did graduate work in
				English before deciding to jump tracks to his digital life, where he's
				been writing software professionally since 1999.  He recently got
				turned on to easyb by one of Andy Glover's talks at a No Fluff Just
				Stuff symposium, and now he gets to write stories *and* work with
				software at the same time.  When he's not coding or spending time with
				his family, he's playing golf, reading a book, or trying to rope
				people into playing Settlers of Catan.</p>
